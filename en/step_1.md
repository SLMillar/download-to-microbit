### Download your program to the micro:bit

To run your program on your physical micro:bit, you will need to download your program file to it.

Click on the `Download` button below the micro:bit simulator.

**Debug:** My micro:bit won't pair

If your micro:bit won't pair using the method above, it will download the program for you. 

**Windows:** Open **File Explorer** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `This PC` on the left-hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file to it. Your program will be saved to your micro:bit and you should be able to use it.

**MacOS:** Open **Finder** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `Locations` on the left-hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file to it. Your program will be saved to your micro:bit and you should be able to use it.

If your micro:bit isn't showing up, try unplugging it and plugging it back in. You can also try a different USB port or USB cable if they are available.
